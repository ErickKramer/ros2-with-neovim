# ROS 2 with Neovim

Neovim setup to work with ROS 2 Humble in `Ubuntu 22.04`.

This configuration can be used to develop ROS components in

- C++
- Python

This repository is meant to be used as a starting point for Neovim. Therefore,
it is configured as a single [init.lua](./.config/nvim/init.lua) file.

The file contains explanation for the different plugins used and their configurations.

The goal is that you use this repository and begin your Neovim configuration. You can add and remove plugins based on your needs.

## Installation

I have a provided a config script to speed up the process of configuring Neovim for you.
This script with install all the dependencies, download a version of Neovim, and deploy the configuration files to the correct path.

By default `./deploy.sh` will download Neovim version `v0.9.5`, which is the latest stable release, to `~/open_source/neovim/`.

You can change the version and path by calling the script with `./deploy --path <YOUR_PATH> --version <VERSION>`. NOTE: The version can be a branch or a tag from the Neovim repository.

### Post Installation

The first time you open Neovim, it will install all the Treesitter configurations, as well as the LSPs, Linters, and DAPs using Mason. This is equivalent to running `:TSUpdate` and `:MasonToolsInstall`

## Plugins

You can check the plugins that are loaded in your Neovim configuration with `:Lazy`

### Colcon Commands

![](./assets/colcon_commands.png)

- `:ColconBuild` -> Build ROS packages in current working directory
- `:ColconBuildSingle <ROS_PKG>` -> Build the given <ROS_PKG>
- `:ColconBuildDebug` -> Build ROS packages with Debug symbols
- `:ColconBuildDebugSingle <ROS_PKG>` -> Build the given <ROS_PKG> with Debug symbols
- `:ColconTest` -> Run `colcon test`
- `:ColconTestSingle <ROS_PKG>` -> Run `colcon test --packages-select <ROS_PKG>`
- `:ColconTestResult` -> Run `colcon test-result --all`

### C++

#### LSP

[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) is the LSP here configured. If you use the previously listed commands, this configuration is already taken cared of. Additionally, it generates a `compile_commands.json` that is needed by clang.

### Linters

- [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/): Requires a `.clang-tidy` config file
- [cpplint](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint)

### Formatting

- [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html): Requires a `.clang-format` config file

### Python

#### LSP

- [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) is the LSP here configured
- [ruff_lsp](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp): Handles linting files exposing LSP diagnostics. This is configured using `pyproject.toml`

#### Formatting

- [ruff_format](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/): Requires a `pyproject.toml` config file. This is the formatter used by default, if not found, black would be used.

## Use cases hints

### General

- Open file tree `:NvimTreeToggle`
- Open current file in tree `:NvimTreeFindFile`

- Open search files `:Telescope find_files`
- Grep local files `:Telescope live_grep`
- Open keymaps `:Telescope keymaps`
- Open old files `:Telescope oldfiles`

- Open multi-file search and replace `:Spectre`

- Open diagnostics `:TroubleToggle`
- Open diagnostics for current file `:TroubleToggle document_diagnostics`
- Open diagnostics for whole workspace `:TroubleToggle workspace_diagnostics`

- Open Git `:Git`
- Compare changes `:DiffviewOpen <BRANCH1>..<BRANCH2>`

### LSP

**NOTE: space is the leader key**. You can check the actual commands used by the keybindings in the `init.lua`

- Expand diagnostics `space + e`
- Hover Documentation `K`
- Switch between header and source `Shift + Tab`
- Type definition `space + D`
- Go to definition `gd`
- Go to declaration `gD`
- Code Action `space + ca`
- Rename `space + rn`

### Debugging

For debugging files you can use the following commands

**Note:** Make sure to compile the C++ files with debug symbols enabled

- Add breakpoint to current line `:DapToggleBreakpoint`
- Open Debugger UI `F2`
- Start debugger `:DapContinue`
  - Select the desirable Configuration (e.g. Launch File)
- You can then use the UI to step over/into or `:DapStepOver`

### Snippets

A collection of snippets have been configured for C++ and Python. You can find them in the [snippets dir](./.config/nvim/snippets/)

To explore the available snippets do `:Telescope luasnip`

## Comments

This repository is heavily inspired on [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), which is a similar Neovim configuration for general purposes.

Please, check out their great explanation on [how to configure and extend a Neovim configuration](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim#configuration-and-extension).
